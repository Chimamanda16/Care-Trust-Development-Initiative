# Care-Trust-Development-Initiative

The official website for CareTrust Organization.

An NGO that focuses on helping to eliminate poverty in Nigeria.

Activities include sensitizing the people, youth, children, the elderly, providing help to individuals and groups in need by providing monetary and emotional incentives.

Helping people who have been let down in life: the abused, the less priviledged, the downtrodden, the physically challenged.

This website is to help create more awareness and pull more people together to continue the cause and ultimately make Nigeria better for us.
